According to "CompassXport Operation Manual 3.0.9.2
"*:

> MALDI data needs parameter definition tables to be successfully exported. 
> Two tables (in xml format) are installed alongside CompassXport.exe: 
> FlexVariableTable.xml and ICRVariableTable.xml.
> If you plan to call CompassXport via COM, you need to copy these 2 XMLs 
> into the same directory as your calling program. E.g. for VBScript this is 
> C:\Windows\System32 or C:\Windows\SysWow32\ (Windows 64 Bit)
